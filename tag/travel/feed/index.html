				<description><![CDATA[Sharing you own experiences serves multiple functions insofar as people can learn.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are all aware that music and “atmosphere” go together.&nbsp; We might put on relaxing music for a quiet romantic dinner, but listen to something livelier while doing&nbsp;some physical&nbsp;work or exercise or when out socializing in larger groups.</p>



<p>Recent studies showing that listening to fast music while driving increases the rate of car accidents and the Mozart Effect claims to&nbsp;increase intelligence. Tempo and Rhythm&nbsp;and its combination has an immediate physical impact on our perceptions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p> <em>Music was my refuge.</em> <em>And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.</em> </p></blockquote>



<p>The rhythm of an object&nbsp;suggests more or less frequent movement to qualify the repetitive nature of the&nbsp;underlying beat, even though the tempo of a piece of music might be slow and relaxed. A high frequency of notes can suggest a degree of contained excitement. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full animated"><a class="image-popup" href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1975" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113.jpg 1920w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113-300x200.jpg 300w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113-768x512.jpg 768w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A good piece of music</span> often is one that we could hum, sing or whistle. Even if they are reasonably close together with a variety of nice&nbsp;harmonious intervals&nbsp;between them, rhythms similar to that of speech can be preferred as a melodies.</p>



<p>Between 80-100 is moderately&nbsp;alert and interested otherwise 100 upward are increasingly lively excited or agitated. Since&nbsp;the heartbeat and the music tempo&nbsp;have a strong degree of suggestion, 120-160 is common in some energetic situations. Music suggests movement as it moves in time; and unconsciously we keep associating ourselves with the music while&nbsp;talking, walking, running, dancing etc. Generally a melody consists&nbsp;of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them.</p>



<p>Generally a melody consists&nbsp;of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them.  Although instrumental musical can stretch those boundaries a little, melodies are very similar to sentences that our&nbsp;brains are designed&nbsp;to speak and listen to. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>We are all aware that music and “atmosphere” go together.&nbsp; We might put on relaxing music for a quiet romantic dinner, but listen to something livelier while doing&nbsp;some physical&nbsp;work or exercise or when out socializing in larger groups. </strong></p>



<p>Recent studies showing that listening to fast music while driving increases the rate of car accidents and the Mozart Effect claims to increase intelligence. Tempo and Rhythm and its combination has an immediate physical impact on our perceptions. This is a proved fact in real world.</p>



<p>The rhythm of an object suggests more or less frequent movement to qualify the repetitive nature of the underlying beat, even though the tempo of a piece of music might be slow and relaxed. A high frequency of notes can suggest a degree of contained excitement. Music tends to have a steady tempo to it, often measured in beats per minute. Most of the music based on simple observation is in the range of 50-200 beats per minute, the same as the extreme range of our heartbeats. </p>

<p>Music tends to have a steady tempo to it, often measured in beats per minute. Most of the music based on simple observation is in the range of&nbsp;<a href="https://ombra.pikarthouse.com/main/new-old-trends/#">50-200 beats per minute</a>, the same as the extreme range of our heartbeats. The music tempo of the piece of music roughly equates with the heartbeat associated with the corresponding state or emotions.</p>



<h4>WHERE WORDS LEAVE OFF</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p>Since&nbsp;the heartbeat and the music tempo have a strong degree of suggestion, 120-160 is common in some energetic situations. Music suggests movement as it moves in time; and unconsciously we keep associating ourselves with the music while<em>&nbsp;talking, walking, running, dancing etc.</em></p>



<p>Agood melody <em>(even if it doesn’t have words)</em>&nbsp;often is one that we could hum, sing or whistle. Even if they are reasonably close together with a variety of nice&nbsp;<strong>harmonious intervals</strong> between them, rhythms similar to that of speech can be preferred as a melodies. Generally a melody consists of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them. </p>

<p>I think I started&nbsp;to enjoy the ride more than my seven year old son, who always got excited during the odd bus trip, especially if it was an open top bus and he would be&nbsp;<a href="#">allowed upstairs</a>. Then my enjoyment started to fade as we had to actually stop to let some people get on. After using my own transport for so many years this was a nuisance. Music tempo of the piece of music roughly equates with the heartbeat.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px"><em>Any operator running 24-7 needs to keep a close eye on drivers’ hours, but Milton Keynes — based Cawleys goes that extra mile to prevent slip-ups. Tachographs are analysed on the spot so traffic controllers have all the necessary information to debrief each driver at the end of every shift. </em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size"> The time lapse between starting the shift and driving off is also scrutinised to see if drivers had sufficient time to complete their daily walk around vehicle check.  As a result, they end up doing more work. The transport manager Sara Buckingham&nbsp;says:&nbsp;“We feel it’s a very important part of the day to know exactly what the driver has been doing and has complied with everything we do.” </p>



<h4>1. COMPLETE COMPLIANCE</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys’ fleet ranges from 7.5-tonners for collecting office waste through to liquid tankers that deal with chemical and toxic waste. It operates throughout London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire. Cawleys has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Buckingham says that with skip lorries in particular, some drivers are invariably quicker at completing jobs than others. As a result, they end up doing more work. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped animated"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_120.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_120.jpg" alt="" data-id="1982" data-link="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/media_120/" class="wp-image-1982" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_120.jpg 1000w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_120-150x150.jpg 150w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_120-300x300.jpg 300w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_120-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_121.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_121.jpg" alt="" data-id="1983" data-link="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/media_121/" class="wp-image-1983" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_121.jpg 1000w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_121-150x150.jpg 150w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_121-300x300.jpg 300w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_121-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h4>2. ENSURE SYSTEMS</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://ombra.pikarthouse.com/main/new-superhero-in-amsterdam/#">Ensure systems</a>&nbsp;and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. Keep records up-to-date and publicise ones such as accident rates to help to raise awareness.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thereafter I would simply say “Surprise me.” She hated it when I said that. That made me want to say it even more. I think I was in her room all of 10 times if that. Yet it all mattered so much. Instead, depot managers reward drivers on an ad hoc basis. Drivers are aware of it, but they’re not chasing it. Cawleys has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><em>In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted and they&#8217;re still beautiful.</em> </p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ensure systems and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. Persevere with any changes because benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation. </p>



<h4>3. MAKING QUICK DECISION</h4>
