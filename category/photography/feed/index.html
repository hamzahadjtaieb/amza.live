<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size"><strong>In my opinion, hobby is the key of life. Only through devoting yourself to your hobbies and making an effort to pursue what you are fond of can you get success eventually. Then, you will gain wealth, happiness and popularity.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hobby is the cornerstone of one’s life and is the essential element of success. Why do I say so? Let me explain it for you below.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">First of all, when an individual is interested in something, he will be eager to try his best to understand something deeply since each person has curiosity. To get detailed information of something is the base of doing that thing well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it&#8217;s to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they&#8217;re valued. </p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To&nbsp;gain success needs continuous persistence, numerous efforts, a strong will to succeed and the spirit of never give up. Only when a person is interested in something can he has all of the qualities I mentioned above.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image animated"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><a class="image-popup" href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1973" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-200x300.jpg 200w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a consequence, never neglect the power and effect of interest. It is a potential power which is lying inside one’s heart and when one discover it and make good use of it, he will of course gain unbelievable force and faith to pursue his dreams, to achieve his own targets, to get his own wealth and success.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instead, depot managers reward drivers on an ad hoc basis. Drivers are aware of it, but they’re not chasing it. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys&nbsp;has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance. Ensure systems&nbsp;and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. Keep records up-to-date and publicise ones such as accident rates to help to raise awareness. Persevere with any changes because the benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation. New legislation is also covered during toolbox talks delivered by the company’s in-house driver trainer Rob Jones. Buckingham describes him as an important contact point. </p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-align-center"><strong>In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they&#8217;re still beautiful.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people! In either case a strong motivation must be found to maintain the constant flow of blog content needed to both attract readers and keep them coming back!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing you own experiences serves multiple functions insofar as people can learn and/or be entertained by what you share. If you happen to have a good amount of experience to share than this type of blogging platform.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some people are simply ‘naturals’&nbsp;at finding the best in others and making others realize their own potential, are you one of them? Having a blogging platform that ‘picks people up’ and gets them motivated is one of the most popular type of sites. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are all aware that music and “atmosphere” go together.&nbsp; We might put on relaxing music for a quiet romantic dinner, but listen to something livelier while doing&nbsp;some physical&nbsp;work or exercise or when out socializing in larger groups.</p>

<p>The rhythm of an object&nbsp;suggests more or less frequent movement to qualify the repetitive nature of the&nbsp;underlying beat, even though the tempo of a piece of music might be slow and relaxed. A high frequency of notes can suggest a degree of contained excitement. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A good piece of music</span> often is one that we could hum, sing or whistle.

Since&nbsp;the heartbeat and the music tempo&nbsp;have a strong degree of suggestion, 120-160 is common in some energetic situations. Music suggests movement as it moves in time; and unconsciously we keep associating ourselves with the music while&nbsp;talking, walking, running, dancing etc. Generally a melody consists&nbsp;of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them.</p>

<p>Recent studies showing that listening to fast music while driving increases the rate of car accidents and the Mozart Effect claims to increase intelligence. Tempo and Rhythm and its combination has an immediate physical impact on our perceptions. This is a proved fact in real world.</p>



<p>The rhythm of an object suggests more or less frequent movement to qualify the repetitive nature of the underlying beat, even though the tempo of a piece of music might be slow and relaxed. A high frequency of notes can suggest a degree of contained excitement. Music tends to have a steady tempo to it, often measured in beats per minute. Most of the music based on simple observation is in the range of 50-200 beats per minute, the same as the extreme range of our heartbeats. </p>

<p>Music tends to have a steady tempo to it, often measured in beats per minute. Most of the music based on simple observation is in the range of&nbsp;<a href="https://ombra.pikarthouse.com/main/new-old-trends/#">50-200 beats per minute</a>, the same as the extreme range of our heartbeats. The music tempo of the piece of music roughly equates with the heartbeat associated with the corresponding state or emotions.</p>



<h4>WHERE WORDS LEAVE OFF</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p>Since&nbsp;the heartbeat and the music tempo have a strong degree of suggestion, 120-160 is common in some energetic situations. Music suggests movement as it moves in time; and unconsciously we keep associating ourselves with the music while<em>&nbsp;talking, walking, running, dancing etc.</em></p>



<p>Agood melody <em>(even if it doesn’t have words)</em>&nbsp;often is one that we could hum, sing or whistle. Even if they are reasonably close together with a variety of nice&nbsp;<strong>harmonious intervals</strong> between them, rhythms similar to that of speech can be preferred as a melodies. Generally a melody consists of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide animated"><a class="image-popup" href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_026.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_026.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1888" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_026.jpg 1920w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_026-300x200.jpg 300w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_026-768x512.jpg 768w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_026-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></figure>



<p>I think I started&nbsp;to enjoy the ride more than my seven year old son, who always got excited during the odd bus trip, especially if it was an open top bus and he would be&nbsp;<a href="#">allowed upstairs</a>. Then my enjoyment started to fade as we had to actually stop to let some people get on. After using my own transport for so many years this was a nuisance. Music tempo of the piece of music roughly equates with the heartbeat.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size"><strong>In my opinion, hobby is the key of life. Only through devoting yourself to your hobbies and making an effort to pursue what you are fond of can you get success eventually. Then, you will gain wealth, happiness and popularity.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hobby is the cornerstone of one’s life and is the essential element of success. Why do I say so? Let me explain it for you below.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">First of all, when an individual is interested in something, he will be eager to try his best to understand something deeply since each person has curiosity. To get detailed information of something is the base of doing that thing well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it&#8217;s to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they&#8217;re valued. </p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To&nbsp;gain success needs continuous persistence, numerous efforts, a strong will to succeed and the spirit of never give up. Only when a person is interested in something can he has all of the qualities I mentioned above.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image animated"><figure class="alignleft"><a class="image-popup" href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1968" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106.jpg 1280w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106-200x300.jpg 200w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a consequence, never neglect the power and effect of interest. It is a potential power which is lying inside one’s heart and when one discover it and make good use of it, he will of course gain unbelievable force and faith to pursue his dreams, to achieve his own targets, to get his own wealth and success. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instead, depot managers reward drivers on an ad hoc basis. Drivers are aware of it, but they’re not chasing it. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys&nbsp;has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance. Ensure systems&nbsp;and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. Keep records up-to-date and publicise ones such as accident rates to help to raise awareness. Persevere with any changes because the benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation. New legislation is also covered during toolbox talks delivered by the company’s in-house driver trainer Rob Jones. Buckingham describes him as an important contact point. </p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-align-center"><strong>In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they&#8217;re still beautiful.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people! In either case a strong motivation must be found to maintain the constant flow of blog content needed to both attract readers and keep them coming back!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing you own experiences serves multiple functions insofar as people can learn and/or be entertained by what you share. If you happen to have a good amount of experience to share than this type of blogging platform.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some people are simply ‘naturals’&nbsp;at finding the best in others and making others realize their own potential, are you one of them? Having a blogging platform that ‘picks people up’ and gets them motivated is one of the most popular type of sites. </p>

<p style="font-size:22px"><em>Any operator running 24-7 needs to keep a close eye on drivers’ hours, but Milton Keynes — based Cawleys goes that extra mile to prevent slip-ups. Tachographs are analysed on the spot so traffic controllers have all the necessary information to debrief each driver at the end of every shift. </em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size"> The time lapse between starting the shift and driving off is also scrutinised to see if drivers had sufficient time to complete their daily walk around vehicle check.  As a result, they end up doing more work. The transport manager Sara Buckingham&nbsp;says:&nbsp;“We feel it’s a very important part of the day to know exactly what the driver has been doing and has complied with everything we do.” </p>



<h4>1. COMPLETE COMPLIANCE</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys’ fleet ranges from 7.5-tonners for collecting office waste through to liquid tankers that deal with chemical and toxic waste. It operates throughout London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire. Cawleys has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Buckingham says that with skip lorries in particular, some drivers are invariably quicker at completing jobs than others. As a result, they end up doing more work. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://ombra.pikarthouse.com/main/new-superhero-in-amsterdam/#">Ensure systems</a>&nbsp;and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. Keep records up-to-date and publicise ones such as accident rates to help to raise awareness.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thereafter I would simply say “Surprise me.” She hated it when I said that. That made me want to say it even more. I think I was in her room all of 10 times if that. Yet it all mattered so much. Instead, depot managers reward drivers on an ad hoc basis. Drivers are aware of it, but they’re not chasing it. Cawleys has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ensure systems and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. Persevere with any changes because benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation. </p>



<h4>3. MAKING QUICK DECISION</h4>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The time lapse between starting the shift and driving off is also scrutinised to see if drivers had sufficient time to complete their daily walk around vehicle check. The transport manager Sara Buckingham says: “We feel it’s a very important part of the day to know exactly what the driver has been doing and has complied with everything we do.”</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys’ fleet ranges from 7.5-tonners for collecting office waste through to liquid tankers that deal with chemical and toxic waste. It operates throughout London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire. Cawleys has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance.  </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Persevere with any changes because benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation.

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>It may take weeks, months and even years to make a internet site known. Many people ask themselves, why blog, what’s the sense?</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation. Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="#">Creating blog content</a>&nbsp;that solves common problems associated with a particular niche reflect noble intentions. Here is a look of some different reasons or the motivations behind why many blog.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped animated"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1920" data-link="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/media_058/" class="wp-image-1920" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-150x150.jpg 150w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-300x300.jpg 300w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-768x768.jpg 768w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg" alt="" data-id="1964" data-link="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/media_102/" class="wp-image-1964" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg 1000w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-150x150.jpg 150w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-300x300.jpg 300w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing an interest or personal passion&nbsp;with like minded people is both an enjoyable and self gratifying experience! Much like having a lot of experience to share, if you are passionate about what you base your blog content on, this type of platform will likely be easy and even a wonderful joy to maintain. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p> <em>The first thing you need to decide when you build your blog is what you want to accomplish with it, and what it can do if successful.</em></p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is not a negative but rather a point that it does in fact take time and a strong motivation to consistently create blog content people find interesting. For those who aspire to make money blogging this commitment must be even more stronger. It simply takes more time to get people to spend money then it does to get them to read free content of interest to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think I started&nbsp;to enjoy the ride more than my seven year old son, who always got excited during the odd bus trip, especially if it was an open top bus and he would be&nbsp;‘allowed upstairs’. Then my enjoyment started to fade as we had to actually stop to let some people get on.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size"><strong>In my opinion, hobby is the key of life. Only through devoting yourself to your hobbies and making an effort to pursue what you are fond of can you get success eventually. Then, you will gain wealth, happiness and popularity.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hobby is the cornerstone of one’s life and is the essential element of success. Why do I say so? Let me explain it for you below.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">First of all, when an individual is interested in something, he will be eager to try his best to understand something deeply since each person has curiosity. To get detailed information of something is the base of doing that thing well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it&#8217;s to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they&#8217;re valued. </p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To&nbsp;gain success needs continuous persistence, numerous efforts, a strong will to succeed and the spirit of never give up. Only when a person is interested in something can he has all of the qualities I mentioned above.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image animated"><figure class="alignleft"><a class="image-popup" href="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111.jpg"><img src="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1973" srcset="https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111.jpg 1280w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-200x300.jpg 200w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://syra.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_111-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a consequence, never neglect the power and effect of interest. It is a potential power which is lying inside one’s heart and when one discover it and make good use of it, he will of course gain unbelievable force and faith to pursue his dreams, to achieve his own targets, to get his own wealth and success.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instead, depot managers reward drivers on an ad hoc basis. Drivers are aware of it, but they’re not chasing it. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys&nbsp;has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance. Ensure systems&nbsp;and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. Keep records up-to-date and publicise ones such as accident rates to help to raise awareness. Persevere with any changes because the benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation. New legislation is also covered during toolbox talks delivered by the company’s in-house driver trainer Rob Jones. Buckingham describes him as an important contact point. </p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-align-center"><strong>In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they&#8217;re still beautiful.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people! In either case a strong motivation must be found to maintain the constant flow of blog content needed to both attract readers and keep them coming back!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing you own experiences serves multiple functions insofar as people can learn and/or be entertained by what you share. If you happen to have a good amount of experience to share than this type of blogging platform.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some people are simply ‘naturals’&nbsp;at finding the best in others and making others realize their own potential, are you one of them? Having a blogging platform that ‘picks people up’ and gets them motivated is one of the most popular type of sites. </p>
