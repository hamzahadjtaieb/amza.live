				<description><![CDATA[Sharing you own experiences serves multiple functions insofar as people can learn.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are all aware that music and “atmosphere” go together.&nbsp; We might put on relaxing music for a quiet romantic dinner, but listen to something livelier while doing&nbsp;some physical&nbsp;work or exercise or when out socializing in larger groups.</p>



<p>Recent studies showing that listening to fast music while driving increases the rate of car accidents and the Mozart Effect claims to&nbsp;increase intelligence. Tempo and Rhythm&nbsp;and its combination has an immediate physical impact on our perceptions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p> <em>Music was my refuge.</em> <em>And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.</em> </p></blockquote>



<p>The rhythm of an object&nbsp;suggests more or less frequent movement to qualify the repetitive nature of the&nbsp;underlying beat, even though the tempo of a piece of music might be slow and relaxed. A high frequency of notes can suggest a degree of contained excitement. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full animated"><a class="image-popup" href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1975" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113.jpg 1920w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113-300x200.jpg 300w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113-768x512.jpg 768w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_113-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A good piece of music</span> often is one that we could hum, sing or whistle. Even if they are reasonably close together with a variety of nice&nbsp;harmonious intervals&nbsp;between them, rhythms similar to that of speech can be preferred as a melodies.</p>



<p>Between 80-100 is moderately&nbsp;alert and interested otherwise 100 upward are increasingly lively excited or agitated. Since&nbsp;the heartbeat and the music tempo&nbsp;have a strong degree of suggestion, 120-160 is common in some energetic situations. Music suggests movement as it moves in time; and unconsciously we keep associating ourselves with the music while&nbsp;talking, walking, running, dancing etc. Generally a melody consists&nbsp;of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them.</p>



<p>Generally a melody consists&nbsp;of a linear sequence of tones. The notes should have durations which are not too short and not too long, and should not be in an extreme range or shouldn’t have large awkward jumps between them.  Although instrumental musical can stretch those boundaries a little, melodies are very similar to sentences that our&nbsp;brains are designed&nbsp;to speak and listen to. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>It may take weeks, months and even years to make a internet site known. Many people ask themselves, why blog, what’s the sense?</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation. Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="#">Creating blog content</a>&nbsp;that solves common problems associated with a particular niche reflect noble intentions. Here is a look of some different reasons or the motivations behind why many blog.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped animated"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1920" data-link="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/media_058/" class="wp-image-1920" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-150x150.jpg 150w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-300x300.jpg 300w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-768x768.jpg 768w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption"> Charm of existence </figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg" alt="" data-id="1964" data-link="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/media_102/" class="wp-image-1964" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg 1000w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-150x150.jpg 150w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-300x300.jpg 300w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing an interest or personal passion&nbsp;with like minded people is both an enjoyable and self gratifying experience! Much like having a lot of experience to share, if you are passionate about what you base your blog content on, this type of platform will likely be easy and even a wonderful joy to maintain. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p> <em>The first thing you need to decide when you build your blog is what you want to accomplish with it, and what it can do if successful.</em></p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is not a negative but rather a point that it does in fact take time and a strong motivation to consistently create blog content people find interesting. For those who aspire to make money blogging this commitment must be even more stronger. It simply takes more time to get people to spend money then it does to get them to read free content of interest to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think I started&nbsp;to enjoy the ride more than my seven year old son, who always got excited during the odd bus trip, especially if it was an open top bus and he would be&nbsp;‘allowed upstairs’. Then my enjoyment started to fade as we had to actually stop to let some people get on.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hobby is the cornerstone of one’s life and is the essential element of success. Why do I say so? Let me explain it for you below.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">First of all, when an individual is interested in something, he will be eager to try his best to understand something deeply since each person has curiosity. To get detailed information of something is the base of doing that thing well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it&#8217;s to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they&#8217;re valued. </p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To&nbsp;gain success needs continuous persistence, numerous efforts, a strong will to succeed and the spirit of never give up. Only when a person is interested in something can he has all of the qualities I mentioned above.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image animated"><figure class="alignleft"><a class="image-popup" href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1968" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106.jpg 1280w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106-200x300.jpg 200w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_106-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a consequence, never neglect the power and effect of interest. It is a potential power which is lying inside one’s heart and when one discover it and make good use of it, he will of course gain unbelievable force and faith to pursue his dreams, to achieve his own targets, to get his own wealth and success. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instead, depot managers reward drivers on an ad hoc basis. Drivers are aware of it, but they’re not chasing it. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cawleys&nbsp;has no formal incentive scheme to raise driver productivity for fear of compromising its stance on compliance. Ensure systems&nbsp;and procedures are realistic and workable and review them frequently. Keep records up-to-date and publicise ones such as accident rates to help to raise awareness. Persevere with any changes because the benefits will not always be realised without any hesitation. New legislation is also covered during toolbox talks delivered by the company’s in-house driver trainer Rob Jones. Buckingham describes him as an important contact point. </p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-align-center"><strong>In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they&#8217;re still beautiful.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people! In either case a strong motivation must be found to maintain the constant flow of blog content needed to both attract readers and keep them coming back!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing you own experiences serves multiple functions insofar as people can learn and/or be entertained by what you share. If you happen to have a good amount of experience to share than this type of blogging platform.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some people are simply ‘naturals’&nbsp;at finding the best in others and making others realize their own potential, are you one of them? Having a blogging platform that ‘picks people up’ and gets them motivated is one of the most popular type of sites. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>It may take weeks, months and even years to make a internet site known. Many people ask themselves, why blog, what’s the sense?</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">This reaction is based primarily upon the time and commitment it takes to maintain a blogging platform. Nowadays many make money blogging and therein is found their&nbsp;motivation. Others however take a more &#8216;personal&#8217;&nbsp;approach and they base their blog content upon merely helping or serving people.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="#">Creating blog content</a>&nbsp;that solves common problems associated with a particular niche reflect noble intentions. Here is a look of some different reasons or the motivations behind why many blog.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped animated"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="1920" data-link="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/media_058/" class="wp-image-1920" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-150x150.jpg 150w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-300x300.jpg 300w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058-768x768.jpg 768w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_058.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg" alt="" data-id="1964" data-link="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/media_102/" class="wp-image-1964" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102.jpg 1000w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-150x150.jpg 150w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-300x300.jpg 300w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_102-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sharing an interest or personal passion&nbsp;with like minded people is both an enjoyable and self gratifying experience! Much like having a lot of experience to share, if you are passionate about what you base your blog content on, this type of platform will likely be easy and even a wonderful joy to maintain. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p> <em>The first thing you need to decide when you build your blog is what you want to accomplish with it, and what it can do if successful.</em></p></blockquote>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is not a negative but rather a point that it does in fact take time and a strong motivation to consistently create blog content people find interesting. For those who aspire to make money blogging this commitment must be even more stronger. It simply takes more time to get people to spend money then it does to get them to read free content of interest to them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide animated"><a class="image-popup" href="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_101.jpg"><img src="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_101-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1963" srcset="https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_101-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_101-300x200.jpg 300w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_101-768x512.jpg 768w, https://SYRA.pikarthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/media_101.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think I started&nbsp;to enjoy the ride more than my seven year old son, who always got excited during the odd bus trip, especially if it was an open top bus and he would be&nbsp;‘allowed upstairs’. Then my enjoyment started to fade as we had to actually stop to let some people get on.</p>
